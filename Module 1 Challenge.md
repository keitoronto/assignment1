## What Is It
Wealthsimple Technologies Inc. is Canadian FinTech company that uses robo-advisors technology. Robo-Advisor uses artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to construct financial advice. 

The company was founded in 2014 by Michael Katchen. Katchen developed a speardsheet with tips to help his colleagues set up investment portfolios. Interest in the spereadsheet helped inspired the idea for the inception of wealthsimple. He raised a $2-million seed round by investors and a venture capital firm. 
Wealthsimple provides an online investment management combining a robo-advisor platform with access to live advisors to help Canadians financially. 

## Why This Matters
The chief benefit of robo-advisor is to provide finance advice based on mathematical rules. It berings services to a broader audience with lower cost compared to traditionally exclusive wealth management services. There are major Canadian companies from a small to large scale; BMO Smartfolio, Questwealth Portfolios, Justwealth, ModernAdvisor. 
The robo-advisors technologies were launched in 2008 during the financial crisis. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robo-advisor
By the end of 2015, almost 100 companies that use robo_advisors were managing $60 billion assets of clients.

Wealthsimple surpases number of features compared to its competiters: easy sign-up process, no account minimums, easy, automatic contributions, no account inactivity fees, mobile app access innovative features, empetitive fees. 
 

## Why This May be Interesting
In October 2022, wealthsimple became Canada's first nonbank, non-credit-union direct settlement by the Bank of Canada. 
This means that traditional institutions have now recognized and accepted that the Fintech technology backed financial services is no more gimmik but legitimate financail services. 

Wealthsimple has added many [services](https://www.wealthrocket.com/investing/wealthsimple-review/) since its inception. However, they need few improvements to stay competitive. According to [MoneySense magazine](https://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/wealthsimple-trade-review/), it says "There is a lack of in-depth investment analytics and educational tools, which can make things harder on some newbie investors.". 


Another emerging fintech service is peer to peer lending. Peer-topeer (P2P) lending enables individuals to obtain loans directly from other individuals, cutting out the financial institution as middleman. P2P lenders are individuals who seek a better return on their savings. Wealthsimple should provide P2P platform to expand their services. 
To expand Wealthsimple services, they should create a peer to peer lending platform where lenders match with borrowers. By incorporating the peer to peer lending feature as one of services, they can offer more diversified services and give users more flexible choices.
