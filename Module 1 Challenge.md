# Case Study Proposal: Wealthsimple
![image](Robo-Advisor-1.jpg)


## What Is It
<font size="3">**Wealthsimple Technologies Inc.** </font>is a Canadian FinTech company that uses robo-advisors technology. Robo-Advisor uses artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to construct financial advice. 

The company was founded in 2014 by Michael Katchen. Katchen developed a speardsheet with tips to help his colleagues set up investment portfolios. Interest in the spreadsheet helped inspire the idea for the inception of Wealthsimple. He raised a $2-million seed round from investors and a venture capital firm. 
Wealthsimple provides an online investment management service combining a Robo-advisor platform with access to live advisors to help Canadians financially. 

## Why This Matters
The chief benefit of Robo-advisor is to provide financial advice based on mathematical rules. It brings services to a broader audience with lower cost compared to traditionally exclusive wealth management services. There are Canadian competitors that use Robo-advisor technologies such as BMO Smartfolio, Questwealth Portfolios, and Justwealth. 

The Robo-advisors technologies were launched in 2008 during the financial crisis. By the end of 2015, almost 100 companies that use Robo-advisors were managing $60 billion assets of clients. Wealthsimple surpasses a number of features compared to its competitors: easy sign-up process, no account minimums, easy, automatic contributions, no account inactivity fees, mobile app access, and competitive fees. 

## Why This May be Interesting
In October 2022, Wealthsimple became Canada's first non-bank, non-credit-union approved for direct settlement by the Bank of Canada. 
This means that traditional institutions have now recognized and accepted that the FinTech technology backed financial services is no more a gimmick but a legitimate financial services. 

Wealthsimple has added many [services](https://www.wealthrocket.com/investing/wealthsimple-review/) since its inception. However, they need a few improvements to stay competitive. According to [MoneySense magazine](https://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/wealthsimple-trade-review/), it says "There is a lack of in-depth investment analytics and educational tools, which can make things harder on some newbie investors.". 


Another emerging FinTech service is peer-to-peer lending. **Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending** enables individuals to obtain loans directly from other individuals, cutting out the financial institution as middleman. P2P lenders are individuals who seek a better return on their savings. Wealthsimple should provide a P2P platform to expand their services. 
To expand Wealthsimple services, they should create a Peer-to-peer lending platform where lenders match with borrowers. By incorporating the peer-to-peer lending feature as one of services, they can offer more diversified services and give users more flexible choices.
